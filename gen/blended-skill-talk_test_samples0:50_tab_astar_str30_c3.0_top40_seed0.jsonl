I guess they are just timid creatures though.  Lucky you guys! Have you ever", "yes, once. she climbed up the stairs and had to stand up. We were so scared! lol. It only took a couple of step step in. My other cat is the same way and she's a sweetheart. The mamsma cat - she's so", "Your' lucky my cat's are so timid.

I would like to try but I just don't have the stamina! Do you ever run with a dog?", "I don't have a dog, I just don't have the time to dedicate to a pet! Do you have any pets?", "No pets, just a crowd of feral cats from the neighborhood that roam through the yard.
