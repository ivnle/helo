What ways are you improving the orphanages?","Well I'm specifically working on ways to reduce child laundering that can happen when orphanages are negligent. These are essentially schemes were intercountry adoptions are made fraudulently. Children are literally bought and sold. Sometimes children wind up with good parents. Sometimes not.","Are there other ways to improve the orphanages as well?","Sure, there's deinstitutionalisation.
